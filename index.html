          <h2>Boredom + Free time = Business Idea?</h2>
          <p>
            Just a brief backstory, my first business idea was nowhere near
            Can'tCook— well, the name was close. I was thinking of making
            artisan keycaps, Can'tType (see the resemblance?), because of my
            obsession with mechanical keyboards. But the pandemic is rough and I
            had problems with suppliers. Boredom struck and I tried cooking new
            recipes to relieve stress, then the rest is history.

          <h2>Simple Ingredients, Extraordinary Taste</h2>
          <p>
            My cousin and cousin-in-law were my "first customer". They noticed
            how fast I was at wrapping gyoza considering that it's my first time
            doing this. I researched and developed my recipe for a week,
            measuring every spices to the milligram. Once my pilot batch was a
            success, I took and edited a photo then posted it on Facebook.

          <h2>Many ways to eat good!</h2>
          <p>
            There's so many way to cook gyoza that I can't answer my customers
            when they ask, "how should I cook this?". You could steam them,
            maybe pan fry before steaming, or even put them on a soup. As long
            as you are satisfied, there's no one rule to cook my products.

          <h2>To infinity and... beyond?</h2>
          <p>
            I launched this business a week before starting my classes at BCIT.
            I also had different recipes lined up after my success with gyoza.
            However, it's tough managing a food business all by myself when I'm
            studying. This is why I documented the whole recipe so that my
            not-so-talented-at-cooking girlfriend could continue it and my loyal
            customers, or "suki" as we call it in Filipino, will not miss on
            good food.
